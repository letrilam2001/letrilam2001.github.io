                    decided to show our coffee-making process to show you our dedication to the craft.</p>
                <p>Our coffee beans were imported from Thai Nguyen thanks to the hard workers there. From then on, it is
                    transported to us, and we commit ourselves to not waste the valuable resources and work put into
                    producing the beans by the farmers.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the rigidity of the coffee beans, we assure our customers that their cup of coffee is
                    worth the time they spent in our shop.</p>
                <p>We believe in our quality of our cup of coffee, and we are certain you do too.</p>
